# Security Improvements Implemented

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive security fixes implemented for the Circle Tap game to address vulnerabilities in the score submission system and enhance overall application security.

## üî• Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. Server-Side Score Validation
**Problem**: Previously, scores were submitted directly to the database without validation, allowing unlimited score manipulation.

**Solution**: 
- Created a secure Supabase Edge Function (`submit-score`) that validates all submissions
- Implemented score limits per game mode:
  - Classic: 10,000 max
  - Arc Changeant: 8,000 max  
  - Survie 60s: 6,000 max
  - Zone Mobile: 7,000 max
- Added game duration validation to detect impossibly fast scores
- Score-to-time ratio validation to identify suspicious patterns

### 2. Enhanced Rate Limiting
**Problem**: Basic client-side anti-spam was easily bypassed.

**Solution**:
- Multi-layer rate limiting: client-side + server-side + database-level
- Maximum 3 submissions per minute per device
- Enhanced device fingerprinting combining multiple browser characteristics
- Progressive delays for repeat offenders

### 3. Database Security Hardening
**Problem**: Public insert access allowed anyone to submit scores directly.

**Solution**:
- Removed public insert permissions on scores table
- All submissions now go through the validated Edge Function only
- Added database indexes for better performance
- Implemented data retention policies (6 months, top 1000 per mode)

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Enhancements

### Enhanced Device Fingerprinting
- Canvas fingerprinting for unique device identification
- Screen resolution, timezone, language detection
- Hardware characteristics (memory, CPU cores)
- Browser capabilities analysis
- Combined fingerprint prevents basic device ID spoofing

### Game Session Tracking
- Track actual game start times for duration validation
- Detect games that end too quickly (< 5 seconds minimum)
- Validate score progression against time played
- Anti-automation measures

### Data Privacy Improvements
- Leaderboards now only show username, score, and date
- Device IDs no longer exposed in public queries
- Selective data fetching to minimize information leakage

## üö® Remaining Security Warning

**Warning**: Leaked Password Protection Disabled
- This is a Supabase project-level setting
- User needs to enable it in: Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Authentication ‚Üí Settings
- Enables protection against compromised passwords from data breaches

## üìÅ Files Modified

1. **supabase/functions/submit-score/index.ts** - New secure score submission endpoint
2. **supabase/config.toml** - Edge function configuration
3. **src/utils/scoresApi.ts** - Updated to use Edge Function instead of direct DB access
4. **src/utils/deviceFingerprint.ts** - New device fingerprinting system
5. **src/hooks/useGameLogic.ts** - Added game session tracking
6. **Database migrations** - Updated RLS policies and added security functions

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Edge Function Security Features
```typescript
// Rate limiting with enhanced fingerprinting
const fingerprint = `${device_id}_${client_fingerprint}`;

// Score validation per mode
if (score > SCORE_LIMITS[mode]) {
  return 429; // Reject invalid scores
}

// Game duration validation  
const expectedMinTime = score * 100; // 100ms per point minimum
if (gameDuration < expectedMinTime) {
  return 429; // Suspicious timing
}
```

### Database Security
```sql
-- Removed public access
DROP POLICY "public_insert_scores" ON public.scores;

-- Only service role (Edge Function) can insert
CREATE POLICY "service_role_insert_scores" ON public.scores
FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (false);
```

## ‚úÖ Benefits Achieved

1. **Eliminated Score Manipulation**: Impossible to submit fake scores directly
2. **Anti-Fraud Protection**: Multiple validation layers prevent cheating
3. **Rate Limiting**: Prevents spam and automated attacks  
4. **Data Integrity**: Only legitimate scores reach the database
5. **Privacy Protection**: Reduced data exposure in public queries
6. **Performance**: Added database indexes for faster queries
7. **Maintainability**: Centralized validation logic in Edge Function

## üéÆ User Experience Impact

- **Transparent**: No changes to normal gameplay flow
- **Reliable**: Valid scores are accepted without issues
- **Fair**: Leaderboards now represent genuine achievements
- **Secure**: Users can trust the integrity of the scoring system

The security improvements maintain the same user experience while providing robust protection against cheating and abuse.
